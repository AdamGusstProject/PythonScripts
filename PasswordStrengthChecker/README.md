# Password Strength Checker

## Overview

This tool analyzes the strength of a user‑provided password and returns a rating based on length, character variety, and overall complexity. It was built as part of my ongoing effort to improve my Python skills and develop clean, expressive logic structures.

## Features

- Evaluates password length and character diversity  
- Provides a strength rating (e.g., Weak, Moderate, Strong)  
- Offers feedback to help improve password quality  
- Designed with a clear, readable decision‑tree structure  

## How to Run

bash
python PasswordStrength.py

## Purpose

This script is part of my learning journey as I transition from SysAdmin to InfoSec. It focuses on improving:
- Logical flow
- Condition ordering
- Code expressiveness
- Real‑world security awareness

## Future Improvements

- Add entropy calculations
- Expand feedback messages
- Add unit tests
- Improve scoring logic as my skills grow
