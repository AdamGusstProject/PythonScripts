# PythonScripts Repository

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of Python tools, utilities, and learning projects created as part of my journey from SysAdmin to InfoSec. Each folder represents a standalone script or tool, organized by purpose. The goal of this repo is to build hands-on experience, strengthen my developer mindset, and create practical utilities for cybersecurity and system administration.

## Repository Structure
Below is a high-level description of the major folders in this repository. Each folder contains its own script(s) and, when applicable, a README with more details.

- **PasswordStrengthChecker/**  
  A password strength evaluation tool that analyzes complexity and provides feedback.

- **FileMove/**  
  Scripts for automating file organization and directory cleanup tasks.

- **FileMoveScript/**  
  Additional or experimental versions of file-moving utilities.

- **FileZipUtility/**  
  Tools for compressing and archiving files.

- **FileHashUtility/**  
  Scripts for generating and verifying file hashes (useful for integrity checks).

- **nmapScanners/**  
  Python wrappers or helpers for running and parsing Nmap scans.

- **SecurityAnalsysTools/**  
  Security-related utilities and experiments.

- **TelnetPortTest/**  
  A simple tool for testing connectivity to remote ports using Telnet.

- **Calculator/**  
  A basic calculator script used for Python fundamentals practice.

- **SmallTestScripts/**  
  A sandbox for small experiments, prototypes, and learning exercises.

## Purpose of This Repository

- Build practical Python tools for cybersecurity and system administration  
- Strengthen my understanding of Python fundamentals  
- Develop clean, expressive, well-structured code  
- Document my learning journey and growth as a developer  
- Create reusable utilities for real-world tasks  

## How to Use This Repository

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AdamGusstProject/PythonScripts
2. Navigate into any folder to explore its scripts.
3. Each tool is self-contained and can be run independently.
4. Some folders include their own README files with usage instructions.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Standard library modules (most scripts require no external dependencies)
- Any additional requirements will be listed in the folder-specific README files

## Future Plans

- Add more InfoSec-focused tools
- Improve documentation across all folders
- Refactor older scripts for clarity and structure
- Expand password strength checker with more expressive logic
- Add unit tests as projects mature
